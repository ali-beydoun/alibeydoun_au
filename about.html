                    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Technology Director based in Sydney, currently leading platform strategy in financial services. Before that, I spent over a decade building and leading Salesforce teams across some of Australia's fastest-growing companies.</p>
                    <p>What gets me out of bed? Honestly, it's the people stuff. There's something deeply satisfying about helping a team click — watching junior developers grow into leads, seeing a solution architect nail a complex integration, or sitting with a stakeholder who finally gets why we built something the way we did.</p>
                    <p>The technology is important, but it's a means to an end. The real work is understanding what the business actually needs (not just what they're asking for), building a team that can deliver it, and creating an environment where good work can happen.</p>

                    <h3>People First</h3>
                    <p>Technology is built by people. If your team isn't set up to succeed — if they don't have clarity, support, and room to grow — the best architecture in the world won't save you. I spend a lot of time thinking about team dynamics, career development, and creating environments where people can do their best work.</p>

                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Outcomes Over Output</h3>
                    <p>It's easy to get caught up in velocity metrics and feature counts. But I've learned that the only thing that really matters is whether we're solving the problem we set out to solve. Sometimes that means building less, sometimes it means taking a completely different approach. The goal is impact, not activity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Build to Last</h3>
                    <p>Quick fixes have their place, but I've seen too many organisations hamstrung by technical debt and short-term thinking. I push for solutions that will still make sense in two years — even if they take a bit longer to get right. The best systems are the ones your future self will thank you for.</p>

        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-xl">The Journey</h2>
            <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">I didn't start out planning to be a technology director. Like most careers, mine has been a series of opportunities, challenges, and moments where I had to figure things out as I went.</p>

            <p>I started in telecommunications — support and consulting work that taught me how to troubleshoot, communicate with frustrated users, and understand that behind every ticket is a real person with a real problem. Those early years were humbling in the best way.</p>

            <p>From there, I moved into digital marketing, where I got my first real exposure to Salesforce. I was managing business systems for an agency with global operations — coordinating with teams in the US, UK, and across APAC. It was chaotic and fast-paced, but it's where I learned to think about technology as a business enabler, not just a set of tools.</p>

            <p>The roles that followed took me through education technology, real estate, and eventually into HR and workplace services. Each industry had its own challenges, but the pattern was similar: rapid growth, complex requirements, and a need for technology that could scale. I went from analyst to platform manager to delivery manager to head of delivery, each step teaching me something new about leadership, architecture, and getting things done.</p>

            <p>These days, I'm in financial services — an industry with its own unique constraints around compliance, security, and regulatory requirements. It's pushed me to think even more carefully about governance and risk, while still delivering at pace.</p>

            <p>Looking back, the through-line has been Salesforce. It's the platform I know best, and the ecosystem I've built my career in. But more than any specific technology, what I've really been learning is how to build teams that can deliver complex solutions in demanding environments.</p>
